// Express.js API endpoint with error handling
app.post('/api/orders', authenticateToken, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { items, shippingAddress, paymentMethod } = req.body;
    
    // Validate input
    const validation = validateOrderData(req.body);
    if (!validation.isValid) {
      return res.status(400).json({ error: validation.errors });
    }
    
    // Process order
    const order = await orderService.createOrder({
      userId: req.user.id,
      items,
      shippingAddress,
      paymentMethod
    });
    
    // Send confirmation email
    await emailService.sendOrderConfirmation(order);
    
    res.status(201).json({ orderId: order.id, status: 'confirmed' });
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Order creation failed:', error);
